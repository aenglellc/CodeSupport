## About The Project

This is a GitHub repository for Aengle LLC Patreons. Here is a link to our [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/aengle) community!

## Getting Started

To get started using any data or code, click on the folder and file you want. Click on the Copy button in order to copy and paste it into your own code line, or clone the repository to your own GitHub to get access to the full project.

## Usage and Resources

This project is set up so that you can download code snippets to use in your own work, and have example code and data sets to practice with. You may need to download multiple files in order to practice, for example the code and the related data sets. Each code snippet has instructions for which files you need in the comments at the top.

Coding can be tricky! Here are some of my favorite resources for coding and additional demos:
